a) Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a String representing the title of the movie, a String representing the studio, 
   and a String representing the rating as its arguments, and sets the respective class properties to these values.

b) The constructor for the class Movie will set the class property rating to "PG" as default when no rating is provided.
